The david robot in a fun and engaging package. Clarity and purpose is the method and means.

_What about it?_

* 84 cm tall at 3.5 kg constructed of high-strength plastic for ideal weight and reduction of user _fear factor_
	- If it scares you, it can be readily broken
	- Robust enough to withstand fall impacts
	- Replacement parts can be reprinted
* Efficient motors for limbs, powerful motors for bipedal stabilization

	| Actuator | Stall Torque (N.m) | Rated Torque (N.m) |
	|----------|--------------------|--------------------|
	| MX-28AT  | 3.1                | 0.5                |
